###Changing author info

To change the name and/or email address recorded in existing commits, you must rewrite the entire history of your Git repository.

```
Warning: This action is destructive to your repository's history. If you're collaborating on a repository with others, it's considered bad practice to rewrite published history. You should only do this in an emergency.
```

This script will change any commits that previously had the old email address in its author or committer fields to use the correct name and email address.

**Before running this script, you'll need**:
- The old email address that appears in the author/committer fields that you want to change
- The correct name and email address that you would like such commits to be attributed to

1. Create a fresh, bare clone of your repository
2. Copy and paste the script, replacing the following variables based on the information you gathered:
 - `OLD_EMAIL`
 - `CORRECT_NAME`
 - `CORRECT_EMAIL`

```
#!/bin/sh

git filter-branch --env-filter '
OLD_EMAIL="your-old-email@example.com"
CORRECT_NAME="Your Correct Name"
CORRECT_EMAIL="your-correct-email@example.com"
if [ "$GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL" = "$OLD_EMAIL" ]
then
    export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$CORRECT_NAME"
    export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$CORRECT_EMAIL"
fi
if [ "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL" = "$OLD_EMAIL" ]
then
    export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="$CORRECT_NAME"
    export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="$CORRECT_EMAIL"
fi
' --tag-name-filter cat -- --branches --tags
```
